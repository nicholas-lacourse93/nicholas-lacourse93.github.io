I am a final year PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at the University of Exeter. My supervisors are Brit Grosskopf and Oliver Hauser.

In my research, I am primarily interested in the study of belief formation and its impact on labour markets. In particular, Iâ€™m currently exploring how people update beliefs about themselves when they have to incur independent transaction costs to observe information. I am also investigating how third parties hold redistributive preferences over labourers' sorting decisions when there is incomplete information about the labourers' preferences.
